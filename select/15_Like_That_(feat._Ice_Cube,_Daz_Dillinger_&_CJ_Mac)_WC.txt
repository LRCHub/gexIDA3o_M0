Ware of where I put in my time (yea yea yea yea)
In the light you acted shady
Understood you wanted all the spaces
In my heart, soul, body and mind
So when I let you all in, I'm all in
Build you up, you blun in construction
Taught you how to function, perfection (oh)
Took you to the galas, you loved it
I seen you catch your eye on to something
Tell her that this here wasn't nothing (oh)
But you done f*cked it up

Does it stand up strong when she do it
Like that? (still ain't got nothing to show)
I put her on your arm,
Does she shimmer like that? (still ain't got nothing to show)
Yea she lit but sh*t I don't think you
Match (still ain't got nothing to show)
But send her all my love, don't you do me like that

She wanna know how you know (that sh*t gonna get you, ooh)
She want it hard in the stroke (that sh*t gonna get you, ooh)
She finna stop when it's fun (that sh*t gonna get you, ooh)
Don't know what you have til it's gone (that sh*t gonna get you, ooh)

Not just lovers
More like friends so
I want you to know
When you found out
I was trapped now
Reaping what I sew

What she got has been more than basic
Yeah I'm learning right out your pages
Don't f*ck around with a real one
Hold it down, down down down
Go back in time if I could I'd change it
Cause what we had that was all amazing
F*cking her I be contemplating like
What it could've been

Does it stand up strong when she do it
Like that? (still ain't got nothing to show)
I put her on your arm,
Does she shimmer like that? (still ain't got nothing to show)
Yea she lit but sh*t I don't think you
Match (still ain't got nothing to show)
But send her all my love, don't you do me like that
